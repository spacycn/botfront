# Usage with Rasa / X

You can export the conversations created with Botfront to an existing Rasa / Rasa X project.
Head to the Settings menu (left sidebar), select **Import/Export**, and choose Rasa / Rasa X.

You will get a zip file containing all the files required files:

```
awesome-project
|- data/
|--- nlu.md
|--- stories.md
|- config.yml
|- credentials.yml
|- domains.yml
|- endpoints.yml
```

A few things to keep in mind:

#### NLU

Consider removing Botfront specific NLU components, such as `rasa_addons.nlu.components.gazette.Gazette` and `rasa_addons.nlu.components.language_setter.LanguageSetter`

#### Credentials and endpoints

You probably don't need to change them, or if you need to keep credentials from Botfront, be sure to keep the `rasa` and `rest` fields from the `credentials.yml` provided by Rasa X.


### Import

An import tool will be available soon. In the meantime you need to import elements separately from different files.
